## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

## Reactive Content

The navigation bar at the top is constructed at page load based on the number of sections in in the page body.

Clicking on any of the nav bar links scrolls to the linked section instead of following the link.

The top-most section that is completely on the screen becomes slightly shaded and receives nice ambient moving bubbles around it.
